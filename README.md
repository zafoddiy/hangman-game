# Hangman game
A simple hangman game written in C++ and played via terminal. Compiled using g++.
Current build is on Windows only, but can be compiled cross-platform.
In order to play, the words.txt file must be located in the same folder as the executable.
The file can be changed and a word list of any size can be inserted.
Each word must be on a new line.
